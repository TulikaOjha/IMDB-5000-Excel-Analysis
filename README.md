# 🎬 Cinema by the Numbers: Box Office & Ratings Dashboard (1920–2022)

An interactive Excel dashboard analyzing 100+ years of 5500+ movies' data, designed to surface trends in genre popularity, ratings, and box office success.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- ✅ Over **5,500 movies**, **8,000+ actors**, and **2,500+ directors** analyzed
- ✅ Fully **slicer-responsive dashboard** with timeline and genre filters
- ✅ KPIs including **highest grossing movie**, **most prolific actors**, **top-rated titles**

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Ratings, Gross Earnings and runtime have been adjusted using bayesian average

## 📌 Key Insights (Sample)

- **Action** and **Adventure** dominate gross earnings but not average ratings.
- **Biographies** and **Dramas** tend to receive higher IMDb scores.
- Directors like the **Russo Brothers** and **James Cameron** lead in lifetime earnings.

- **The Matrix** despite being released in **1999** is the rated movie of all-time.
- The 2014 saw the highest surge in movie releases.

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

This project sharpened my Excel dashboarding skills, particularly in storytelling with data, using slicers for interactivity, and formatting visuals for clarity and impact. Next step: rebuilding this in **Power BI** with DAX for deeper insights.
