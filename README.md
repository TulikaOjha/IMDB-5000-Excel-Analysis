# Cinema by the Numbers: Box Office & Ratings Dashboard (1920–2022)

An interactive Excel dashboard analyzing 100+ years of 5500+ movies' data, designed to surface trends in genre popularity, ratings, and box office success.

## Project Highlights

- Over **5,500 movies**, **8,000+ actors**, and **2,500+ directors** analyzed (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakkesharv/imdb-5000-movies-multiple-genres-dataset/data)
- Fully **slicer-responsive dashboard** with timeline and genre filters
- KPIs including **highest grossing movie**, **most prolific actors**, **top-rated titles**
- Visuals: bar charts, line graphs, pie and donut charts, area charts
- Clean cinematic theme with intuitive navigation and layout
- Designed for stakeholders to easily identify top-performing talent and industry trends

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Pivot, Charts, Slicers, Named Ranges, Conditional Formatting)
- Raw CSV data cleaned using Excel Power Query
- Ratings, Gross Earnings and runtime have been adjusted using bayesian average

## Key Insights (Sample)

- **Action** and **Adventure** dominate gross earnings but not average ratings.
- **Biographies** and **Dramas** tend to receive higher IMDb scores.
- Directors like the **Russo Brothers** and **James Cameron** lead in lifetime earnings.
- **Avengers: Endgame** was the biggest movie of all-time directed by **Russo Brothers** starring **Chris Evans**, **Chris Hemsworth**, **Mark Rufallo** and **Robert Downey Jr.**.
- **The Matrix** despite being released in **1999** is the rated movie of all-time.
- The 2014 saw the highest surge in movie releases.

## Learning Outcome

This project sharpened my Excel dashboarding skills, particularly in storytelling with data, using slicers for interactivity, and formatting visuals for clarity and impact. Next step: rebuilding this in **Power BI** with DAX for deeper insights.
